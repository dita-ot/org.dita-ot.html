# DITA-OT site plug-in

This is the _DITA Open Toolkit_ plug-in that is used to generate the DITA-OT documentation hosted on the project website at [dita-ot.org][1].

The plug-in extends the default `html5` transformation with additional processing specific to the project website.

The generated HTML topic stubs are combined with [Liquid][2] templates, styled with [Sass][3] and published with [Jekyll][4] from the repository at [github.com/dita-ot/website][5].
